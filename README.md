# [Lightsaber Training](https://erinachavez.github.io/lightsaber_training/)

Similar to [The Jedi Journey](https://github.com/erinachavez/the_jedi_journey) this is a mini game inspired by the *Star Wars* series, styled in a retro 8-bit aesthetic! Although more simple than The Jedi Journey, I believe the code behind this project is better written and more organized. All the same, it's nice to know that my coding skills have improved greatly since making this in 2017 :sweat_smile:
